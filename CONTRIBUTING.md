# Contribute

We love contributions! This analysis guide is open source, built on open source, and we'd love to have you help make it even better!

First off, if directly writing content in this repository is too unfamiliar and you just want to write what you know down, we will be happy to accept contributions in any form.
Our preferences would be for something which is as close to [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) as you are comfortable writing, so if not markdown then plain text, LaTeX, or lightly formatted word documents are all ok (in that order of preference).

If you are happy to contribute directly to the source on GitHub then thank you!
We have tried to make it as approachable as possible, but if you encounter any issues then please let us know.
